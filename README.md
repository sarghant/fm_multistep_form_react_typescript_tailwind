Last month I uploaded a multistep form, which was a challenge from Frontend Mentor, and I decided to build it almost completely Vanilla (used SCSS for styling) to 
make it more difficult. I later decided to build the same project much more cleanly by using React and Typescript and for styling I turned to Tailwind, which really 
is the best CSS framework in how much freedom it provides while also freeing one from the burden of coming up with class names. I was able to style the app exactly 
the same way as I did with CSS (SCSS).
React + Typescript have been installed with Vite.
"npm run dev" to run the app.
